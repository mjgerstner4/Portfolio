									<p>As a Computer Science enthusiast, I embark on a journey fueled by an insatiable curiosity for technology and its applications. My name is Matthew Gerstner, a dedicated learner, and problem-solver 
										based in Overland Park, Kansas. I believe in the transformative power of code and its ability to shape our world.</p>

									<p>My academic expedition commenced at Johnson County Community College, where I pursued an Associate of Arts in Liberal Arts, nurturing the fundamentals of critical thinking and broadening my 
										intellectual horizons. This journey continued to unfold at the University of Missouri - Kansas City, where I pursued a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. Here, my passion for coding found its 
										wings through courses like Python, C++, Java, Artificial Intelligence, Database Management, and Software Engineering.</p>

									<p>While academics laid the foundation, my experiential journey was equally enriching. Beyond the lines of code, I've served as a Baseball Umpire at Blue Valley Recreation. This role was not merely about 
										officiating games; it was about fostering integrity, managing disruptions, mentoring newer umpires, and ensuring the seamless execution of scheduled events. These experiences taught me the essence of 
										composure, fairness, and effective communication, qualities pivotal in both sports and the tech realm.</p>

									<p>Projects have been my canvas for applying theoretical knowledge. From crafting an AI-powered route-finding program in Python to architecting a hospital patient management system in C++, each project 
										has been a testament to my evolving skills. The creation of a simulated college bank project using C++ showcased my prowess in data structures, while developing an energy supplier system in Java 
										highlighted my commitment to efficient system design.</p>

									<p>One of my most intriguing ventures has been collaborating on a comprehensive capstone website project for UMKC’s grader positions. This endeavor epitomized my proficiency in front-end and back-end 
										development, amalgamating HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MongoDB to enhance user experiences and streamline administrative processes.</p>

									<p>Beyond technical prowess, I pride myself on being a problem-solver, an effective communicator, and adept in time management. These skills, coupled with a toolkit encompassing Python, Java, C++, and 
										more, define my ability to navigate through complex challenges and articulate innovative solutions.</p>

									<p>I see each line of code as an opportunity to shape the future, and I am fervently committed to making a meaningful impact in the tech sphere. Whether it's creating intuitive software, contributing to 
										cutting-edge projects, or embracing new technological frontiers, I am constantly seeking avenues to grow, innovate, and collaborate.</p>

									<p>Let’s connect and explore the infinite possibilities that technology offers!</p>
